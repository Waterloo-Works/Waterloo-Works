# 🤖 Resume Parsing & Auto-Fill - Setup Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Reducto PDF Parser** (`lib/resume/reducto-parser.ts`)
- Extracts text from PDF resumes using your Reducto pipeline
- Handles file uploads via Buffer
- Returns structured text + metadata

### 2. **Ollama LLM Extractor** (`lib/resume/ollama-extractor.ts`)
- Uses Ollama Cloud (gpt-oss:120b) to extract structured profile data
- Temperature: 0.1 for consistent results
- Validates and sanitizes all extracted fields
- Returns typed `ExtractedProfileData`

### 3. **Integrated Upload API** (`app/api/profile/resume/route.ts`)
The upload flow now:
1. ✅ Uploads PDF to Supabase Storage
2. ✅ Parses with Reducto pipeline
3. ✅ Extracts structured data with Ollama
4. ✅ Calculates completion score
5. ✅ Auto-fills profile in database
6. ✅ Returns extracted data to frontend

### 4. **Smart Form Auto-Fill** (`app/(shell)/profile/edit/page.tsx`)
- Pre-fills form fields with extracted data
- Merges with existing data (keeps user edits)
- Scrolls to top to show auto-filled fields
- Shows success toast with sparkle emoji ✨

### 5. **Enhanced UI** (`components/profile/ResumeUploader.tsx`)
- Shows "Parsing resume..." while processing
- Different success messages based on parsing outcome
- Handles errors gracefully

## 🎯 How It Works

### Upload Flow
```
User uploads PDF
  ↓
Supabase Storage (with RLS)
  ↓
Reducto Pipeline (PDF → Text)
  ↓
Ollama gpt-oss:120b (Text → Structured Data)
  ↓
Database + Frontend Auto-Fill
```

### Data Extraction
The Ollama prompt extracts:
- ✅ Headline (generated from role + skills)
- ✅ Location (from recent job/education)
- ✅ Current Role
- ✅ Years of Experience (calculated from dates)
- ✅ Experience Summary (2-3 sentences)
- ✅ Skills (all mentioned technologies)
- ✅ Primary Skills (top 3-5)
- ✅ Education (degree, school, year)
- ✅ Desired Roles (inferred from experience)
- ✅ URLs (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio, personal site)

## 📊 Testing

### Test with Your Resume

1. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000/profile/edit
2. **Upload your resume** (Eden_Chan_Resume.pdf)
3. **Watch the magic happen:**
   - Upload completes
   - Parsing takes 5-10 seconds
   - Form auto-fills with your data
   - Toast shows "Resume uploaded and parsed! Profile auto-filled ✨"
4. **Review and save**

### Expected Results
Based on your resume:
- **Headline:** "Software Developer | React & Node.js" or similar
- **Location:** "San Francisco" or "Waterloo, ON"
- **Current Role:** "Software Developer" (from Ideaflow)
- **Years of Experience:** ~2.5 years
- **Skills:** Typescript, Node, Python, Go, React, NextJS, Docker, AWS, etc.
- **Primary Skills:** [Top 5 most prominent]
- **Education:** "Bachelor of Computer Science", "University of Waterloo", 2024
- **URLs:** edenchan.ca, linkedin.com/in/edenchan42, github.com/eden-chan

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Logs
The API route logs detailed progress:
```bash
📤 Uploading resume to Supabase...
✅ Resume uploaded: c69ac553-f9ce-45e6-bd6f-74fe2b08ee8d/1729031234567-Eden_Chan_Resume.pdf

   - Primary Skills: 5
   - Experience: 2.5 years
💾 Saving profile to database...
✅ Profile saved! Completion score: 85
```

### If Parsing Fails
- Resume still uploads successfully
- Toast shows warning
- User can fill form manually
- Raw text stored in `resumeRawText` for re-parsing later

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

- **Reducto:** ~$0.10 per resume (1 page)
- **Ollama Cloud gpt-oss:120b:** ~$0.03 per resume
- **Total:** **~$0.13 per resume**

For 1000 users: **$130** (one-time per user)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 Ideas
1. **Re-parse Button** - Let users re-trigger parsing with improved prompts
2. **Confidence Scores** - Show which fields LLM is confident about
3. **Diff View** - Show before/after extraction for user review
4. **Multi-file Support** - Parse multiple resumes, pick best extraction
5. **Async Processing** - Move to background queue for faster uploads
6. **Model Tuning** - A/B test different prompts/models for accuracy
